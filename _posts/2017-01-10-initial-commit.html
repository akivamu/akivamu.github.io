Today I decide to start recording my daily life events, of course just my public information. There are so many things come into me every day and I need to record them. More over, I think blogging can bring more benefits:<br /><br /><ul><li>Train my self to think in a better way, so I can express my idea in a systematically style. If my writing is good for you to understand it easily, I succeed.</li><li>Practice writing English in particular.</li><li>Understand my daily problems and record it for you will strengthen my knowledge - acting as a teacher.</li><li>Receive your comments, sharing and feedback will help me expand my mind and my point of view.</li></ul><br />That's it! Just my first post, with all these grammar errors. Hoping each year, when I read this post again, I can make change and improve it.
