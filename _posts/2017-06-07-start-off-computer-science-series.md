## Someday you will get tired

CS or Software Engineering is my main path in life. I've been working, learning very hard for many years. I hoped one day I can take a rest and enjoy with all knowledge I accumulated.

And that day never comes.

I realized that this field has no limit and it's changing everyday, just like everything else in life. I
have to keep working, learning new thing, forever.

Quite frustrated, I take a rest to rethink. Then I accepted the reality, but maybe with a good methodology,
I can ease my life? Yes, it could, it's called **plan**.

## Plan

First is the career path:

- Fundamental years
  - This is when you all start as software developer/tester.
  - You will gather experience in the field.
  - You will then upgrade your skills into senior level, prepare to the next level
- Specialized years
  - This is where you choose to be a tech specialist or becoming a manager
  - There are some overlapped knowledges, like high level concepts, soft skills...
  - And at sometime, a specialist can become manager and vice versa

This series focuses on technical path: Junior -> Senior -> Architect/Specialist

It's hard to perfectly arrange skills/knowledges into each level, so let's combine into one.

- Blockchain
- Softskills
  - Communication
  - Estimation
  - Mentoring

If you are serious, invest heavily in fundamental stuffs because you will use them for the whole life, and
they will barely outdated.

Spend enough time for trending stuffs, as they will help you find jobs. Some trending stuffs will become
fundamental. So make sure you choose correct one.

Softskills are always needed as it make you efficient.
