## Someday you will get tired

CS or Software Engineering is my main path in life. I've been working, learning very hard for many years. I hoped one day I can take a rest and enjoy with all knowledge I accumulated.

And that day never comes.

I realized that this field has no limit and it's changing everyday, just like everything else in life. I
have to keep working, learning new thing, forever.

Quite frustrated, I take a rest to rethink. Then I accepted the reality, but maybe with a good methodology,
I can ease my life? Yes, it could, it's called **plan**.

## Plan

First is the career path:

- Fundamental years
  - This is when you all start as software developer/tester.
  - You will gather experience in the field.
  - You will then upgrade your skills into senior level, prepare to the next level
- Specialized years
  - This is where you choose to be a tech specialist or becoming a manager
  - There are some overlapped knowledges, like high level concepts, soft skills...
  - And at sometime, a specialist can become manager and vice versa

This series focuses on technical path: Junior -> Senior -> Architect/Specialist

It's hard to perfectly arrange skills/knowledges into each level, so let's combine into one.

## Knowledges for technical path

- Fundamental technical
  - [Computer fundamental](cs-computer-fundamental)
  - [Networking](cs-networking)
  - [Data structure & algo](cs-data-structure-algorithm)
  - Database design
  - Design patterns
  - Design principles: SOLID, Clean Architecture, IoC, AOP
  - System design: microservice, microfrontend...
- Trending technical
  - Process: Agile, CI/CD
  - Languages, libraries, frameworks
  - Containerizing
- Softskills
  - Communication
  - Estimation
  - Mentoring
