The number of software related jobs has been increased significantly recent years. Many companies don't require
college degree. If you have experience or simply prove that you can fulfill the job, you're hired and you're software
developer.

Although I got B.Eng in Electrical, I started my career as a software developer. I had no CS background, but I could do
my jobs very well, varying from embedded system, to mobile app or web app. I thought I was a decent Software Engineer, 
until Amazon came to my country to hire Software Engineer. I took the first round Code Challenge and failed.

The test required data structures and algorithms, things that I were not good. During 7 years of work, I've rarely had
a task that require algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Tree Traversal, Sorting... I thought these are just for
academic purpose.

I did some research, and found out big companies require candidates to have strong CS knowledge, especially algorithms.
Why? Because the thinking is that the people who are better at algorithms will be able to learn faster, which is more
important than knowing particular languages/tools used by the company.

That test really got me. I realized that I did incorrectly refer me as software engineer. In fact I'm a software
developer. On that day, I knew what I should do next: CS.

I found [an interesting resource](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) about a developer also wanna 
become a software engineer, just like me! This man is really cool, and his repo is perfect. But it mainly focuses
on knowledge relate to interview, and I want more knowledge in Computer Science. So I decided to setup my own repo.

At first, I thought about creating a single repo that covers all those knowledge, but then I recognized that it could
be easier for maintenance if I split it up.  
Here is the layout:
  - [Part 1: Computer fundamental](https://github.com/akivamu/computer-fundamental)
    - Processor and Memory
    - Startup
    - Operating System
        - Scheduler
        - Kernel and drivers
        - Processes and Threads
    - Compiler, linker, assembler...
  - [Part 2: Networking](https://github.com/akivamu/networking)
    - Information theory
    - Protocol
  - [Part 3: Software Engineering](https://github.com/akivamu/software-engineering)
    - Data structure
    - Algorithm
    - Design Pattern
    - System Design
    - Database

That's a lot of works needed to be done. So I would start with my top priority first: Software Engineering.
