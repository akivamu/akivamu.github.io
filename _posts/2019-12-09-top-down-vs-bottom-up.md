Taking from [SoF link](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/134639/334815)

Use Top down approach:

- When the vision is clear (e.g. building a web app)
- When rebuilding a solution (also the vision is clear)

Use Bottom up approach:

- When the general vision is not clear
- When the detail is specified (e.g. database vendor used, encryption algo...)

Hybrid approach ("local" Top down)
