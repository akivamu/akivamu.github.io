## Introduction

Referred from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle):

- The SDLC (aka application development life-cycle) describes a process for planning, creating, testing,
and deploying an information system
- The concept is applied to general system, may includes hardware, software...
- There are usually 6 phases: analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation,
and evaluation.
- There are several models:
  - Waterfall:
    - Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models
    - Complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks
  - Agile:
    - Focus on lightweight processes
    - Allow for rapid changes
  - Iterative:
    - Focus on limited project scope
    - Expanding or improving products by multiple iterations
  - ...
- Models vs SDLC phases
  - For waterfall, all phases built as one go
  - For Agile, Iteractive: each short iteration include all phases
- Project vs Product
  - Project life cycle: encompasses all the **activities** of the project
  - Systems development life cycle: focuses on realizing the product **requirements**

## Phases

### Initiation

- Concept proposal
- Cost/Benefit analysis
- Output: decision to start project

### Requirement Analysis & Definition

- Requirements collection from interviews, questionaire...
- Feasibility checking
- Output: [System Requirement Spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification)

### Planning (management)

- Output:
  - Resource estimation (human, time)
  - Scheduling, Roadmap

### Designing

- Base on SRS to define the system
- Output:
  - Architecture Spec
  - Function Spec

### Development and testing

- Base on design, development and testing can be performed in parallel
  - Dev: coding and testing
  - Test: define strategy, test case and run test
- Output:
  - Source code, deployable
  - Test strategy, test report

### Acceptance, installation, deployment

Push to production

### Operations & Maintenance

May do evaluation, feature update, bug fix...

### Disposal

Perform migration to new system, destroy artifact, archiving...
