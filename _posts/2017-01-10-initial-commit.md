Today I decide to start recording my daily life events, of course just my public information. There are so many things
come into me every day and I need to record them. More over, I think blogging can bring more benefits:

- Train my self to think in a better way, so I can express my idea in a systematically style. If my writing is good
for you to understand it easily, I succeed.
- Practice writing English in particular.
- Understand my daily problems and record it for you will strengthen my knowledge - acting as a teacher.
- Receive your comments, sharing and feedback will help me expand my mind and my point of view.

That's it! Just my first post, with all these grammar errors. Hoping each year, when I read this post again, I can make
change and improve it.
