[Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} is a tool that helps to
tracking traffic of visitor into your website, for example: from where user redirect to your website; how long they
stay on your website or specific page; information like age, gender, location, browser, phone model, their interests...

Those data really bring a lot of benefits and opportunities. You can understand your audience better, can tuning and
optimize your website to get more traffic, or just making some sales or place ads based on their interests.

Of course you can use Google Analytics even if you don't use Blogger. Just some simple steps and you can have Google
Analytics ready to track your website. Google also have some guides for this, and they also very clear and easy. Here
I just describe common steps:

- In Google Analytics Admin panel, create a new property
  - A property can be your website, your mobile app...
  - Each property will have a unique tracking ID. This tracking ID is auto generated by Google Analytics when you
  create new property.
  - Google Analytics also provides you a short Javascript code, which will be used in next step.
