## Intro

Caching means making heavy time-consuming task into lightweight less time-consuming task, examples:

- Database querying, with input is the query, output is result:
  - Without caching: heavy querying for each request
  - Caching: lookup for saved result for each request (lighter)
- CDN, with input is the request, output is the resource:
  - Without caching: request-response go through multiple network hops
  - With caching (nearby cached server): request-response go through nearest cached server
