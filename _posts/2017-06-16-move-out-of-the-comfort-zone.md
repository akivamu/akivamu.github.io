title: Move out of the comfort zone
category:

This is the first post of series **Daily stuffs**. I will write everyday, about anything, maybe just an interesting
quote that I saw, some little achievement, or just my random thought. I think I will keep up this habit everyday.  
Anyway, this series is just for me. I leave it public just because Jekyll does not support private post.

OK, I will start with a saying.

# Move out of the comfort zone
And there are some supporting quotes:
  - Life begins at the end of your comfort zone
  - Are you really happy or just comfortable?
  - In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
  - If you can't leave the comfort zone, at least expand it.
  - blah blah blah

So, what to do next?
  - Leave in another country.
  - Find a different job.
  - Define a different daily routine.
