I've been using English for a long time, but mostly in verbal, informal communication. I always struggle when writing 
anything long (like this post). I've had difficulty choosing correct sentence structures, tenses and phrases. While
writing down above words, I have to google:
  - Present Perfect Tense (using English...)
  - Present Simple Tense (`always` signal word)
  - Phrase `have difficulty`

I decide to start off with **tenses**. I found [two](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/grammar/tenses_table.pdf) 
[websites](https://www.ego4u.com/en/cram-up/grammar/tenses) that provide good summary. But I guess I should rewrite
them, for better memorization.
