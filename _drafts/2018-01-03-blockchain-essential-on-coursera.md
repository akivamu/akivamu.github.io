Today I start learning a [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-blockchain-essentials-for-developers/) about
blockchain. I would note some key points in this post.

What is blockchain, at the very highest level?
  - Is a trusted, distributed ledger
  - Has a shared business processes among members of business network.

Bitcoin vs Blockchain?

  - Bitcoin:
    - Unregulated shadow currency.
    - Very first application of blockchain.
    - Resource intensive.

  - Blockchain
    - Identity over anonymity (network members know about counter-parts)
    - Selective endorsement over proof of work (choose who validates a transaction)
    - Generic assets over currency
    
Blockchain components
  - Shared ledger: for records of transactions
  - Smart contract: rules for transactions
  - Privacy: authorization for ledger
  - Trust: the ledger is trusted source via endorsement
