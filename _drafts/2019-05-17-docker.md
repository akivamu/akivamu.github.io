[Userspace vs Kernel space](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/architecting-containers-part-1-why-understanding-user-space-vs-kernel-space-matters)

- There is only one shared kernel
  - Container is like a packaged userspace applications
  - There is no separate kernel in container
  - Normal or containerized applications (via syscall) same shared Linux kernel. It is host's kernel
  - Docker engine check to support host kernel
- If host's kernel is changed, will the old container continue to work properly?
  - Not sure
