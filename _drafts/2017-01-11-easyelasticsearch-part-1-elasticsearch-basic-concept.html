Many say that <a href="https://www.elastic.co/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> is powerful and easy to approach. I agree that it is powerful, but easy? I doubt that, at least to me. When I first met Elasticsearch, I found that it has many terms and concepts, and query structure is way more complicated, with nested `query` and `filter` and `term` things.<br /><br />I don't have much time to research it, and my project is already implemented some base code to work with Elasticsearch, so I just make some small changes, refer to base code. I don't feel good at that time, so now I decided to take a serious research, and write down to post series to help me systematically understand Elasticsearch.<br /><br />Reference:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html</a></li></ul><br />All posts belong to this series:<br /><ul><li>Part 1: Elasticsearch basic concept (this post)</li><li>TBD</li></ul><br /><hr /><h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 1: Elasticsearch basic concept</h2><div><br /></div><h3>Elasticsearch is Near Realtime</h3>That means it isn't really realtime - it has a delay. This delay is between the time you index one piece of data, to the time this data is ready to be searched.<br /><br /><h3>How data is stored in computer?</h3>Elasticsearch stores its data in an sub-folder named `data`, in its root folder.<br />Detail here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-dive-into-elasticsearch-storage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">A Dive into the Elasticsearch Storage</a><br />Most of developer don't need to know where Elasticsearch stores data in the disk. I just list it here for reference.<br /><br /><h3>And how it organizes data logically?</h3>The way Elasticsearch organize its data can be covered in these terms:<br /><br /><ul><li>Node: a single machine that run Elasticsearch, belong to a cluster</li><li>Cluster: a group of nodes</li><li>Document: data in JSON format, just like data row in SQL</li><li>Type: documents can be categorized into types</li><li>Index: a group of documents, belong to a cluster</li><li>Shard: index is divided into shards, or just duplicated into shards.</li></ul><div><br />You may confuse between cluster, node and index. It is easier to see a pic:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-diH_MX6CB90/WHIQb7cJtoI/AAAAAAAAEJw/N41IVzPTawQSiRXHAbrOrIXNWaOjGtqlACLcB/s1600/cluster-node-index.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-diH_MX6CB90/WHIQb7cJtoI/AAAAAAAAEJw/N41IVzPTawQSiRXHAbrOrIXNWaOjGtqlACLcB/s400/cluster-node-index.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>This picture describes one cluster, but in two point of view: node and index. You can see `node` and `index` are separated concepts. By that, Index A can be divided into shards (but not necessary), and shards are spread among nodes. That how `node` and `index` work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other concepts like document, type or shard are not that confuse, definition can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_basic_concepts.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Elasticsearch: Basic Concepts</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I will come back and update this post later.</div>
